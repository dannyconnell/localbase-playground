# Localbase Playground

An app for playing around with [Localbase](https://github.com/dannyconnell/localbase) and all the available methods.

*\* Check out the [Localbase Repository](https://github.com/dannyconnell/localbase)*

Localbase Playground contains a bunch of different code snippets (for adding, updating, setting and getting) data to/from a [Localbase](https://github.com/dannyconnell/localbase) database.

You can launch these code snippets (and edit them if you like) in the browser and observe the result in the IndexedDB database and in the console.
